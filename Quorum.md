## **What is a Quorum?**

A **quorum** is:

> A subset of nodes in a distributed system sufficient to **make a decision** (read or write) safely.

In quorum-based replication:

- **Write quorum (W):** minimum number of nodes that must acknowledge a write for it to be considered successful.
- **Read quorum (R):** minimum number of nodes that must respond to a read request for it to be considered valid.

**Goal:** Ensure **consistency** and avoid conflicts even when some nodes fail.

---

## **Rules for Quorum Systems**

1. **Read/Write Intersection:**

[
R + W > N
]

- Guarantees **latest write is seen by reads**.

2. **Write-Write Intersection:**

[
W > N/2
]

- Guarantees **no two writes can fully succeed without sharing a node**, avoiding conflicts.

3. **Minimal Quorum:**

- The smallest subset of nodes that still satisfies rules.
- Usually:

[
\text{Minimal } W = \lceil N/2 \rceil + 1
]
[
\text{Minimal } R = \lceil N/2 \rceil + 1 \quad (\text{if strong consistency is needed})
]

## **Visual Example: N=5**

We have 5 nodes: **A, B, C, D, E**

- Minimal write quorum: **3 nodes**
- Minimal read quorum: **3 nodes**

```
Nodes:    A    B    C    D    E

Write Q:  [A, B, C]  or [B, C, D]  etc.
Read Q:   [C, D, E]  or [A, B, E]  etc.

Intersection:
Any Read Q and Write Q share at least 1 node.
```

**Observation:**

- This overlap ensures reads always see at least one node with the latest write.
- Even if some nodes fail, quorum ensures correct decisions.

---

### **Why N/2 + 1?**

- For N=5:

[
q = \frac{N}{2} + 1 = 3
]

- 3 nodes = **majority** ‚Üí any two majorities intersect on at least 1 node.
- This is the **minimal majority quorum** guaranteeing strong consistency.

If you want, I can also make a **colorful diagram showing nodes and overlapping R/W quorums** ‚Äî it makes the intersection extremely intuitive.

Do you want me to do that?

## Basic Rules for Quorum Systems

In a distributed system with **N replicas**, you define:

- **R** = number of nodes that must respond for a **read**
- **W** = number of nodes that must respond for a **write**

A quorum system ensures **consistency** and **availability** depending on these values.

### Rule 1: Read/Write Intersection

To guarantee that **reads see the latest writes**, the read and write quorums must overlap:

[
R + W > N
]

- This ensures **at least one node has the latest value**.
- Example: N = 5, W = 3, R = 3 ‚Üí R + W = 6 > 5 ‚úÖ

### Rule 2: Write Quorum Alone

Sometimes we also ensure that **write quorums intersect** with each other:

[
W > N/2
]

- This guarantees **no two writes can fully succeed without sharing a node**, preventing write conflicts from going undetected.
- That‚Äôs exactly why `q = N/2 + 1` is used in your code.

### Rule 3: Minimal Quorum

A **minimal quorum** is the **smallest number of nodes needed to form a quorum**.

- Minimal write quorum: ( \lceil N/2 \rceil + 1 )
- Minimal read quorum for strong consistency: same as above if you want **R + W > N**

üí° Intuition:

- If N=5: minimal write quorum = 3, minimal read quorum = 3.
- If N=4: minimal write quorum = 3, read quorum = 2, etc.

> Basically, you need just over half the nodes for a **write** to guarantee intersection with reads.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Trade-offs

- **Strong consistency:** R + W > N
- **Availability:** smaller R and W improve availability but may weaken consistency.
- **Minimal quorum:** optimizes the number of nodes contacted to satisfy rules without unnecessary overhead.

### Quick Table for N=5

| N   | Minimal W | Minimal R | R + W > N?                       |
| --- | --------- | --------- | -------------------------------- |
| 5   | 3         | 3         | 6 > 5 ‚úÖ                         |
| 5   | 3         | 2         | 5 = 5 ‚ùå (may allow stale reads) |
| 5   | 2         | 2         | 4 < 5 ‚ùå (inconsistent)          |
